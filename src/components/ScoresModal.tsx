          The scoring system evaluates your color palette using several
          criteria. Here is how each score is calculated:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
          <li style={{ marginBottom: 16 }}>
            <strong>Swatch Count:</strong> Palettes with 10-20 swatches score
            best. Fewer or more swatches reduce the score, with a small bonus
            for 16-20 swatches.
          </li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: 16 }}>
            <strong>Smoothness:</strong> Measures how closely your palette's
            palette's lightness (L*) values match the ideal steps for your
            swatch count. The closer your palette is to the ideal, the higher
            the score.
          </li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: 16 }}>
            <strong>Hue Variance:</strong> Evaluates how consistent the hue is
            across your palette. Stepwise differences between adjacent swatches
            are rewarded if they are small (0-3Â°), and the total hue difference
            from first to last swatch is also considered. Low-saturation (gray)
            swatches are assigned the hue of the nearest colored swatch.
          </li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: 16 }}>
            <strong>Balance:</strong> Checks if your palette has a balanced
            number of light (L* {">"} 50) and dark (L* {"<"} 50) swatches. The
            more balanced, the higher the score.
          </li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: 16 }}>
            <strong>Symmetry:</strong> Looks for pairs of swatches that are
            symmetric around L* = 50 (e.g., L* 80 and L* 20). More symmetric
            pairs increase the score.
          </li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: 16 }}>
            <strong>Accessibility (Contrast) Score:</strong> Measures how many
            color pairs in your palette meet WCAG contrast ratios (3:1 for A,
            4.5:1 for AA). The score is normalized against the best possible
            palette for your swatch count.
